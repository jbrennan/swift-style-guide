Swift Style Guide
=================

Mostly, just stick to the style Xcode wants you to roll with.

Howeverâ€¦

Braces
------

Opening braces always go on the same line as the thing opening them. Egyptian style.

`self`
------

Always use `self.property` even when you could get away with `property`, because it helps differentiate properties from local variables/constants.
